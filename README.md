# My Personal Dotfiles
These are my configuration files for linux for day to day use (Software Development, EE, Server Managment & Gaming). 
I utelize a combination of Hyprland, Waybar and Hyprpaper for my Desktop look I'm also currently configuring eww to replace Waybar in the long run.
My text editor of choice is emacs and my shell is zsh. I utelize Kitty as a Terminal Emulator.
All the files are configured to my needs. Feel free to share, distribute or do anything else with them as long as it's not malicious.
